        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A deliciously rich and creamy beef stroganoff 
            that's easy to prep in a slow cooker with little-to-no fuss. 
            It smells wonderful and 
            is tasty like no other stroganoff you've had before 
            thanks to the addition of cream cheese along with the sour cream. 
            Serve over hot, buttered flat noodles.</p>
